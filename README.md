# Fraudulent-transaction-detection

This project involved predicting Fraudulent transaction with [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download) dataset. Both Logistic Regression and Random Forest Regression models were employed and evaluated to determine their performance.

i) For Logistic Regression ROC AUC Score: 0.8315447239672459

ii) For Random Forest Regression ROC AUC Score: 0.9081193007591333

Based on this score for my dataset 'creditcard.csv' I found out that Random Regression gives more accurate results compared with Logistic Regression
